## TODO

- See with Berat the proper RBAC configuration.
- See with Berat to increase/remove resource quotas.
- Do we need to always specify `--requests` in `kubectl run` ?
- Fix DNS in cloud nodes

## Warning

- Traceroute between (GCP) cloud nodes (on their public IPs) => chances that we see nothing due to private infra.
